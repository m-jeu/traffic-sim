# traffic-sim
Multi-agent simulation of traffic density using the Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model

<b>What?</b>

An implementation of 2 types of multi-agent traffic simulation, the Nagel-Schreckenberg model,
and an expanded version with 2 lanes.
Details on the design (in Dutch) can be found in the documents folder.

<b>Why?</b>

University course.

<b>Who?</b>

Sjoerd Beetsma, Quincey Mok, Maarten de Jeu.

<b>Where?</b>

<ul>
<li>The simulation code can be found in trafficsim/lib/sim.</li>
<li>A 'main' script that shows a single simulation through a GUI can be found in the root folder.</li>
<li>A Jupyter Notebook that creates graphs and stats about the simulation through batch excecution is also
in the root folder.</li>
<li>A more detailed document on the research etc. can be found (in Dutch) in the documents folder.</li>
</ul>

<b>How</b>

Using at least Python 3.9:

<ul>
<li>Run <i>main.py</i> to view a single simulation through a GUI. Don't forget to enter a number in the
terminal to select a number of lanes.</li>
<li>If you'd like to gain some insight in the process of batch-executing the simulation, and some graphs about
the results, have al ook <i>experiment.ipynb</i>.</li>
<li>If you want to have a look at the research itself (in Dutch), have a look in the <i>documenten</i> folder.</li>
</ul>
